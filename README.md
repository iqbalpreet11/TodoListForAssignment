# TodoListForAssignment
In this repository i created a todolist app using reactjs with typescript and for designing i used tailwind css .

#workflow of the project is same as mentioned in the requirements :

    first i created a button component
    after that there is a seprate component for checkbox
    then i called both these components in TodoRow component
    TodoRow is called in App.tsx file and add new option is also available there.
    only Tailwind css is being used in all application as mentioned.
